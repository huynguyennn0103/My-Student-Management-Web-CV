**Project Readme: Student Management Web Application**

---

## Introduction

Welcome to our student management web application project! This document serves as a guide for developers interested in understanding and contributing to the development of our web application. Our project aims to create a comprehensive platform for managing student data with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities. The project consists of two main folders:

- **backend**: Contains the backend code written in Spring Boot, utilizing technologies such as JPA, Lombok, and others.
  
- **react**: Contains the frontend code written in React, using Axios for HTTP requests and hooks for state management.

## Project Overview

Our web application allows administrators to perform CRUD operations on student records, including creating new students, viewing existing records, updating student information, and deleting students from the database. The backend server handles data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, while the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application.

## Backend Overview

The backend of our project is developed using Spring Boot framework and includes the following key components:

- **Spring Boot**: For building robust and scalable RESTful APIs.
  
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: For object-relational mapping and database operations.
  
- **Lombok**: For reducing boilerplate code and enhancing developer productivity.
  

## Frontend Overview

The frontend of our project is developed using React library and includes the following key components:

- **React**: For building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
  
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend APIs and fetching data.
  
- **Hooks**: For managing state and side effects in functional components.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Set Up Backend**: 
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Follow the instructions in the backend readme file to set up the development environment and run the backend server.

3. **Set Up Frontend**: 
   - Navigate to the `react` directory.
   - Follow the instructions in the frontend readme file to set up the development environment and run the frontend application.

4. **Access the Application**: 
   - Once both backend and frontend are set up and running, access the web application through your web browser.
